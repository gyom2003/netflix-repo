Man must have social interactions for his well being.
Face to face interacitons are going to die. 

For illustrate, nowadays, a lot of young people are slave of these social network.
They can pass a moment of there journey without them, it still a virtual environment, the most important is to achieve in the real world.

if we take the twitter example, a person who follow the news only with this kind of plateform will not have the best informations.
For me the most important is to read, it can be articles or books, because the informations are more sure than twitter (we can find some fake news there).
